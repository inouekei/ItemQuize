        <h1 class="h1-main">How can you contribute to this project?</h1>
        <p class="p-main">
            I don't like to ask you to help in a way which you would feel unconfortable.
            But meanwhile, I am very ambitious in making this project one of main sources of my income as my other ideas about language learning game.
            So this project is a prototype.
        </p>
        <p class="p-main">
            In this page, I will explain my ideas on some general options for monetizing and considerate which would work and which not.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-main">Option1: Subscription payment</h2>
        <p class="p-main">
            If you are financially comfortable enough to buy some coffee to your friends or donate to organizations on a regular basis like me, this option powerfully and directly supports me.
            You will not need to worry after the decision and it doesn't take much time.
            The problem is that it is not for people who are not able to manage much money, like children or people without occupation.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-main">PROS</h3>
        <ul class="ul-main">
            <li>Direct support</li>
            <li>Time saving</li>
            <li>Very easy to introduce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="h3-main">CONS</h3>
        <ul class="ul-main">
            <li>Not for people without money</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h2-main">Option2: Advertisement</h2>
        <p class="p-main">
            In most times, I hate ads.
            It is "Information Violence."
            The user optimization doesn't work well and we need to accept for wasting time usually on what we don't want to know very much.
            Time is the most precious resource for a human being.
            But there can be fair usages.
            For example, how about taking it as a language learning source?
            After all, most ads are short enough to concentrate on.
            And the messages are so clear that one can take specific actions afterward.
            Speaking of videos, various visual or audio techniqus also help learners understand.
        </p>
